Overwriting:
  Physical erasure sufficient for medium-level protection can be achieved
by overwriting the entire data medium or at least the used sectors with a
certain pattern. Certain commercially available products even allow the
physical erasure of individual files.
  Uniform patterns such as "0000" should not be used for overwriting, but
rather patterns such as "C1" (hexadecimal, corresponds to the bit sequence
11000001).
  Following on from that, in a second pass a complementary pattern (for
example 3E, corresponding to the bit sequence 00111110) should be used so
that if at all possible each bit has been changed once.
The overwrite procedure should therefore be repeated at least twice, or
preferably three times, as this provides a better protective effect.
